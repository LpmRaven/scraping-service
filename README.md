# What is Serverless?

The term "Serverless" can be a bit misleading, it does not mean servers are no longer involved but simply that there is no longer a need to manage servers. Instead of managing servers, we use functions-as-a-service (FaaS) such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to execute code.

FaaS allow developers to build:

* Scalable
* Quickly
* Loosely coupled components
* Efficient architectures

You could think of FaaS as if they were Meeseeks.
